# 🧩 SDOM Project Progress Log

SDOM is a **C++23** library built on **SDL3** that brings a DOM-like scene graph and GUI toolkit to 2D applications and games.  
The aim is a small, predictable core for layout, events, and rendering so SDL developers can compose interfaces and in-game UI with familiar patterns and a minimal API surface.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview
A single **Core** orchestrates the SDL runtime (window, renderer, main loop).  
A **Stage** serves as the root of the display tree, while an **EventManager** dispatches input through *capture → target → bubble* phases.  
The **Factory** registers, creates, and tracks resources and display objects by type and unique name, returning typed handles for safe references.  
Layout is driven by an **edge-based anchoring system** that supports asymmetric, responsive designs.

Scripting and configuration are first-class with **Lua via Sol2**, enabling data-driven scenes, rapid iteration, and test automation.  
You can also build everything directly in C++ — Lua is optional — but when enabled it can construct objects, wire scenes, drive dialog, and swap stages at runtime without recompilation.

## 🧠 Documentation Philosophy
SDOM emphasizes clear, living documentation. The Markdown design docs are working papers that evolve with the code — expect them to change as features land and APIs are refined. 

Public APIs are defined in headers and surfaced via Doxygen, with correctness exercised by unit tests.  
If a doc briefly diverges from current behavior, treat the **code as source-of-truth** until the docs catch up.

Diagrams are authored in Mermaid and exported to static SVG/PNG by the repo’s export pipeline, keeping visuals portable while ensuring sources remain editable. Progress updates call out notable documentation changes, and contributions to clarify or correct docs are welcome.

## ⚙️ Scripting and Configuration
Lua (via Sol2) is first-class but optional — you can script scenes and behavior in Lua, build everything in C++, or mix both.

The **Factory** accepts `sol::table` configs alongside initializer structs, and **Core**’s lifecycle hooks make it easy to integrate scripts for iteration and tests.

## 🗓️ October 29, 2025 — Temporal Testing Framework
- **README.md** expanded with clearer build instructions for Debian, Arch, Fedora, macOS, and Windows, plus a screenshot of the Test Harness.  
- Integrated version metadata into README.md.  
- **Automated versioning:** Implemented `gen_version.sh` to auto-generate `SDOM_Version.hpp` and update the README version block during builds.  
- **Unit test refactor:** Added a `frame` parameter to all `onUnitTest(int frame)` methods across **IDisplayObject** subclasses to support frame-synchronous testing.  
- **Per-frame test harness:** The `UnitTests` system now runs tests sequentially per frame, logs formatted pass/fail output, and provides detailed summaries.  
- **Core update integration:** Integrated per-frame unit test execution into `Core::onUpdate()`, including automated shutdown and performance reporting.  
- Transitioned UnitTests from static to frame-synchronous scheduling, enabling validation of timers, multithreaded ops, and async subsystems.

- Completed implementation and verification of all **Mouse** and **Keyboard** event tests.  
- Added behavioral tests for `MouseEnter`, `MouseLeave`, `MouseClick`, and `MouseDoubleClick`.  
- Implemented new keyboard tests for `KeyDown` and `KeyUp` (placeholder for `TextInput`).  
- Reviewed and validated the **event propagation model** (capture → target → bubble).  
- Confirmed readiness for `EventManager` refactor:
  - Split `Queue_SDL_Event()` into modular per-category handlers  
  - Optimize event dispatch paths to reduce redundant copies  
- **Next Steps:**
  - Refactor and clean up `EventManager`
  - Introduce `Queue_Internal_Event()` for non-SDL sources
  - Implement **Timer Objects** with global/local dispatch

🧾 **Summary:** Temporal testing system complete; event verification and EventManager refactor prep finalized.

## 🗓️ October 30, 2025 — Multi-Frame Unit Tests
- Updated `Event_UnitTests` to validate `EventManager` functionality and performance.
- Updated the SDOM_UnitTests framework to support **multi-frame tests** and performance metrics.
- Confirmed that UnitTests are now **re-entrant** and can span multiple frames.

🧾 **Summary:** Multi-frame test harness verified; event timing logic validated.

## 🗓️ October 31, 2025 — 🎃 Core Refactor & Stage Lifecycle Integration

(Yes, I worked on Halloween — scary, isn’t it?)

#### 1️⃣ EventManager Refactor
- Split `Queue_SDL_Event()` into modular sub-dispatchers:
  - `dispatchWindowEvents`, `dispatchKeyboardEvents`, `dispatchMouseEvents`, `dispatchDragEvents`
  - `updateHoverState`, `dispatchWindowEnterLeave`
- Each handles one input domain (window, keyboard, mouse, drag, etc.)
- Reduced event copies, improved readability, and simplified debug flow

#### 2️⃣ Event Dispatch Optimization
- Unified coordinate normalization by event type
- Consistent hit-testing in logical stage space
- Reduced allocations with in-place forwarding
- Simplified `mouseX` / `mouseY` update logic

#### 3️⃣ Drag & Keyboard Improvements
- Fixed phantom drags from uninitialized seeds
- Drag now starts only after valid press + motion
- Added `Drag`, `Dragging`, and `Drop` event handling
- Restored hover stability
- Keyboard events now target focused objects or broadcast globally

#### 4️⃣ Stage Lifecycle Events
- Added `StageOpened` and `StageClosed` support
- Fired automatically in `Core::setRootNode()` on stage switch
- Verified event order and propagation between stages
- Garbage collection confirmed stable during transitions

### 🧠 Unit Tests

| Test | Description | Status |
|:----:|:-------------|:------:|
| `Event_test8` | Mouse behavior verification | ✅ |
| `Event_test9` | Keyboard behavior verification | ✅ |
| `Event_test10` | Multi-frame queue verification | ✅ |
| `Event_test11` | Lifecycle event dispatch verification | ✅ |
| `Event_test12` | Stage lifecycle transition verification | ✅ |

🧾 **Summary:**  
EventManager modularized, drag & keyboard routing fixed, stage lifecycle events integrated, and all core tests passing.  
Next step → migrate tests 9–12 into a new `EventType_UnitTests` module for full event-type coverage.

#### end-of-day

---

### ✅ Next Steps / To-Do
- [ ] Create new **`EventType_UnitTests`** module  
  - Migrate `Event_test9–12` to this module  
  - Add coverage for all registered `EventType`s (`Added`, `Removed`, `EnterFrame`, etc.)
- [ ] Add tests for input dispatch edge cases  
  - Mouse enter/leave on overlapping objects  
  - Keyboard focus transitions  
- [ ] Implement clipboard and text input events (future `EditBox` support)
- [ ] Review deferred `addChild()` / `removeChild()` event timing  
  - Ensure consistent dispatch after traversal completes  
- [ ] Begin performance profiling for event propagation and queue depth
- [ ] 🔧 **Add output suppression flag**  
  - Introduce a `quiet` or `minimal` mode for UnitTest reports  
  - Only display detailed logs or system-level test output when failures occur  
  - Helps reduce report noise and keep summary results concise
