## Project Description
This project is a C++23 application utilizing SDL3 for graphical rendering and event handling. The goal is to create a simple Document Object Model (DOM) API for SDL3, focusing on building a GUI interface for SDL3 developers to use in their games or other cross-platform applications.


## Progress Updates

- **[July 2, 2025]** Initial rough draft and proof of concept.
- **[August 5, 2025]** SDOM secondary rough draft
- **[September 19, 2025]**
    - Proof of concept approved. Main development approved. Work begins officially.
    - Improved Doxygen documentation for all major headers and macros.
    - Added and refined Doxygen comments for SDOM_CLR.hpp, SDOM.hpp, and SDOM_IDataObject.hpp.
    - Grouped and documented interface methods in SDOM_IDataObject for clarity and API usability.
    - Updated build script to run Doxygen from the correct folder, ensuring documentation builds reliably.
    - Fixed Doxyfile issues (footer path, PROJECT_BRIEF syntax) for clean documentation generation.
    - Validated Doxygen output for class, group, and member documentation.
    - `IDataObject` designed.  This base interface class handles JSON parsing and serialization.
    - Core class scaffold implemented as a thread-safe singleton.
    - Core initializes SDL, window, renderer, and texture with correct sizing and color from config.
    - Window and renderer display with correct logical size and background color.
    - Configuration via struct, JSON string, and JSON file is working and uses sensible defaults.
    - Main loop, event polling, and error handling are scaffolded and ready for extension.
    - Added six callback/hook registration methods to `Core`: `registerOnInit()`, `registerOnQuit()`, `registerOnUpdate()`, `registerOnEvent()`, `registerOnRender()`, `registerOnUnitTest()`.
    - Callbacks are invoked at the appropriate lifecycle and event points, enabling user-defined logic for initialization, quitting, updating, event handling, rendering, and unit testing.
    - Added `preserveAspectRatio` and `allowTextureResize` flags to `CoreConfig` for flexible window/texture resizing.
    - Window resizing now supports two modes: aspect ratio preservation and free resizing, controlled by config.
    - Texture resizing can be disabled via config, allowing fixed-resolution rendering regardless of window size.
    - JSON configuration supports both new flags for runtime flexibility.
    - Refined aspect ratio logic to use a static float for original aspect ratio, ensuring accuracy during repeated resizing.

- **[September 20, 2025]**
    - Factory and resource_ptr scaffolding completed; code compiles and runs cleanly.
    - Event system foundation implemented and documented.
    - Doxygen documentation added for major interfaces (Core, Factory, IResourceObject).
    - Example usage of Core and Factory included in documentation.
    - Circular include and pointer management issues resolved (raw pointer for Factory ownership).
    - The SDOM framework now has a working Core singleton, Factory resource management, and resource_ptr smart handle. The codebase is stable, maintainable, and ready for expanded testing and feature development.
- **[September 21, 2025]**
    - Renamed `resource_ptr` to `ResourceHandle` throughout the codebase for clarity.
        - The new name better reflects its role as an opaque handle or key for resource lookup, rather than a smart pointer with ownership semantics.
        - Updated all documentation, examples, and comments to use `ResourceHandle`.
    - Factory resource management and `ResourceHandle` logic fully tested and confirmed:
        - Resources can be added, retrieved, and removed from the Factory.
        - Multiple `ResourceHandle` instances correctly reflect resource existence and become invalid after removal.
        - Type-safe access via `dynamic_cast` is working and robust.
    - Debug output and test scaffolding added to verify resource lifetime and pointer behavior.
    - Resolved copy constructor and assignment operator issues for `ResourceHandle`.
    - Confirmed that the Factory now contains a working `Stage` resource.
    - Next step: Implement parent/child relationships for resources and display objects.
    - Unit test framework will be moved to `onUnitTest()` methods once implemented.
    - **Resource Creation & Initialization:**
        - Verified that resources (especially Stage) are created via the Factory and properly initialized with onInit().
        - Debug output confirms lifecycle methods (onInit, onQuit, onUpdate, onRender) are called for the root stage.
    - **Core & Factory Integration:**
        - Ensured the root node (mainStage) is set and found by Core, with correct debug output.
        - Improved resource creation logic to always use Factory::create, guaranteeing initialization and registration.
    - **Recursive Traversal:**
        - Implemented and tested recursive lambdas for shutdown (onQuit) and unit testing (onUnitTest), with correct type handling and null checks.
    - **Bug Fixes & Stability:**
        - Diagnosed and resolved segmentation faults by adding null checks and debug output.
        - Tested resource handles and pointer management are more robust and safer, but further testing may be required.
    - **Testing & Debugging:**
        - Added debug prints to trace resource creation and lifecycle events.
        - Validated that the system is ready for expanded DOM tree parsing and more complex resource hierarchies.
- **[September 22, 2025]**
    - **Unit Test Framework Refined:**  
        - Simplified the unit test system: now every resource implements `onUnitTests()` for built-in tests.
        - External/custom unit tests are registered and run via the `registerOnUnitTest()` callback, keeping the API minimal and flexible.
        - Removed unnecessary callback registration logic from `IUnitTest`, relying on virtual methods and user callbacks for extensibility.
    - **Consistent Naming:**  
        - Standardized all unit test-related identifiers to use the plural form (`Tests`) for clarity and consistency across the codebase.
    - **External Test Integration:**  
        - Users no longer need to register callbacks for external unit tests.  
        - Instead, external unit test functions (like `Core_UnitTests()` and `Factory_UnitTests()`) are simply called directly from within the already established `registerOnUnitTest()` callback in `main.cpp`.  
        - This approach makes it straightforward to create and run custom unit tests or build a dedicated test application, while maintaining clear separation between built-in and user-defined tests.
    - **API Cleanup:**  
        - Removed redundant or overly complex code from the unit test infrastructure.
        - Ensured the API remains clean, maintainable, and easy to extend.
    - **Debugging & Issue Resolution:**  
        - Diagnosed and resolved issues with singleton access, reference binding, and infinite recursion in callback registration.
        - Improved understanding of C++ function pointer and lambda usage for flexible test registration.
    - **Expanded Test Coverage:**  
        - Added more unit tests for Factory, Stage, and display objects.
        - Confirmed that the unit test system works well for new features.
        - Identified the need for a custom test object (e.g., `Box`) to facilitate comprehensive anchoring and coordinate propagation tests.
        - Planned to add live event tests (drag/drop, deferred add/remove) and prioritize tests for new features as they are developed.
        - Recognized that coverage for older features will be expanded over time, focusing first on the most critical areas.
- **[September 23, 2025]**
    - **Event System Preliminary Testing:**  
        - Successfully integrated and tested the event system with live SDL3 events.
        - Verified that mouse, keyboard, window, and focus events are received and dispatched correctly.
        - Confirmed that custom display objects (Box) receive and handle events as expected.
        - Minimal "life tests" for event propagation and Box object interaction are passing.
        - Debug output confirms event flow from SDL3 through Core, EventManager, and into display objects.
        - Refactored event dispatch logic for single-stage architecture, simplifying code and improving maintainability.
        - Cleaned up circular includes and pointer conversion issues, improving build stability.
        - Next steps: Expand event tests for Box (drag/drop, stacking, anchoring), add more interactive unit tests, and document event system usage.
        - Refactored codebase to use new `DomHandle` and `ResHandle` types throughout.
        - Verified and debugged handle logic, ensuring safe pointer access and robust operator overloading.
        - Cleaned up event system: `EventManager` now fully leverages the handle system, removing unnecessary casts and improving safety.
        - Fixed segmentation faults and infinite recursion issues in tree traversal by clarifying handle usage and recursive logic.
        - Improved code readability and maintainability by removing legacy patterns and redundant checks.
        - All major event and display object interactions now use the new handle API.
        - Codebase is stable, with most reference and legacy issues resolved.
- **[September 24, 2025]**
    - **Factory Refactor:**
    - Completely revised the `Factory` to use `IDisplayObject` instead of `IResourceObject`.
    - Planned to reintroduce `IResourceObject` into the `Factory` later, ensuring compatibility with both resource and display object management.
    - Verified that the `Factory` now supports `IDisplayObject` creation and initialization.
    - **Box Object:**
    - The `Box` object is now fully functional, with lifecycle methods (`onInit`, `onRender`, `onUpdate`, etc.) implemented and tested.
    - Event listener functionality is the only remaining issue, with the `MouseClick` event listener not firing as expected.
    - Began troubleshooting the event listener system, focusing on event propagation, listener registration, and dispatch logic.
    - **Event System:**
    - Continued debugging and refining the event system to ensure proper propagation and listener execution.
    - Verified that `EventManager` correctly dispatches events to the stage and its children.
    - Added debug logs to trace event flow and identify potential issues with `Box` event handling.

# ToDo:
- Resolve the `Box` event listener issue, ensuring that `MouseClick` events are received and processed correctly.
- Expand event system tests to include drag-and-drop functionality, stacking, and anchoring for `Box` objects.
- Reintroduce `IResourceObject` into the `Factory` for resource management alongside `IDisplayObject`.
- Add unit tests for the revised `Factory` and event system to ensure stability and robustness.
- Move resource and pointer tests to `onUnitTest()` methods when available.
- Add comprehensive unit tests for Factory, resource_ptr, and error conditions.
- Language Hooks
    - Plan for hooks to support other languages (e.g., Python bindings).
    - Add placeholder comments or sections.
- Documentation
    - Add Doxygen comments for all public API elements.
    - Update progress.md with daily progress and ToDo items.
- Testing
    - Add unit tests for macros and exception handling.
