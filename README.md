## Overview
SDOM (Simple SDL Document Object Model API) is an experimental, work-in-progress C++23 library that provides a structured approach to building graphical user interfaces and interactive scenes using SDL3. SDOM fully supports SDL3. The Document Object Model is, in short, a robust graphical user-interface system: a tree of display objects and containers with well-defined properties, parent/child relationships, event propagation, and lifecycle semantics‚Äîallowing code to traverse, query, and update elements in a declarative, DOM-like way similar to web DOM concepts but tailored to SDL rendering and input.

The design centers on three core ideas: composability, data-driven configuration, and portability. Composability comes from a small collection of display object primitives and handles that can be composed into complex UIs. Data-driven configuration means scenes and object properties can be created and adjusted from Lua (via Sol2) without recompiling ‚Äî as much or as little Lua as you want can be used to drive an application. We plan to provide dedicated SDL3 bindings for Lua so scripting can directly leverage SDL3 features; that work is in progress. Importantly, SDL3 is already fully available to C and C++ code using SDOM, and first-class bindings for other host languages (for example Rust or Python) are planned for future releases.

This project builds on top of SDL3 ‚Äî it does not modify or replace any SDL internals.

**Note:** This is still a very early pre-alpha version.  All APIs are subject to change.  


## Features
- Simple, composable API for UI and document structures
- Modern C++23 codebase
- Minimal dependencies (SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_ttf)
- Designed for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility

## IDataObject: Data-Driven Base Type

`SDOM::IDataObject` is a flexible, data-driven base class designed for use in SDOM. It allows you to register property accessors (getters and setters) and commands that can be accessed and manipulated via Lua, enabling dynamic configuration, serialization, and behavior of objects.

### Key Features
- Register property accessors for any property using `registerProperty()`
- Get and set properties by name using `getProperty()` and `setProperty()`
- Supports chaining of setters for fluent configuration
- Register and invoke commands (actions) using `registerCommand()` and `command()`
- Designed for dynamic integration with **Lua** (via [Sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2))


## Identifier Conventions

To ensure clarity and consistency across both C++ and Lua, SDOM uses the following naming conventions:

- **Properties and Data Members:**  
  Use `snake_case` (all lowercase, words separated by underscores).  
  Examples: `font_size`, `border_color`, `resource_name`, `tab_enabled`

- **Functions and Methods:**  
  Use `lowerCamelCase` (first word lowercase, subsequent words capitalized).  
  Examples: `setFontSize()`, `getWidth()`, `registerLuaBindings()`

- **Classes, Structs, Enums, and Types:**
  use 'UpperCamelCase` (first word capitcapitalized, subsequent words capitalized)
  Examples: `Button`, `IDisplayObject`, `Label`, `ListBox`, `ComboBox`

- **Private/Protected Members:**  
  End with an underscore (`_`).  
  Example: `name_`, `type_`, `left_`, `anchor_left_`

- **Private/Protected Methods:**  
  Begin with a single underscore (`_`).  
  Example: `_registerLuaBindings()`, `_initBounds()`

**Lua Configuration:**  
- All property keys should be written in `snake_case`.
- Functions exposed to Lua follow the same `lowerCamelCase` convention as C++.

**Migration Note:**  
Older code and examples may use `camelCase` or other styles. These will be updated over time. During transition, both forms may be accepted for compatibility. Please be patient and forgive my laziness and bad habbits. This falls into one of those "get it working first, then make it pretty" categories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++23 compatible compiler
- SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_ttf development libraries
- CMake 3.20 or newer

### Building the SDOM Library
```
git clone https://github.com/warte67/SDOM.git
cd SDOM
./rebuild # to build and install the SDOM library from this folder
```

### Running the Example
```
cd examples/test
./compile # to only build files which have changed
# or
./compile clean # to completely rebuild the library and the test example
./prog # to run the test example
```

### Notable recent changes
- Symbol rename: DisplayObject -> DisplayHandle and AssetObject -> AssetHandle across the codebase and Lua scripts (Oct 2025).
  - The code and examples have been updated; some diagrams and docs still reference the old names and will be updated in a follow-up.
  - Lua compatibility: Lua userdata/type names remain stable where necessary; check the README/changelog for per-release compatibility notes.

### Migration notes
- If you maintain scripts that referenced the old names, search & replace DisplayObject / AssetObject -> DisplayHandle / AssetHandle.
- The repository includes transitional aliases during migration for staged rollouts (if present); prefer the new names in new code.

# Lua Integration and Requirements

SDOM is designed to be **data-driven** and includes built-in support for scripting and configuration through **Lua (via Sol2)**.

### Why Lua?
Lua enables dynamic creation, modification, and serialization of DOM objects at runtime ‚Äî letting you define UI layouts, animation sequences, and event behavior without recompiling. Lua scripts can access most of SDOM‚Äôs API, and future releases will expand this integration even further.

### Lua Installation

**Debian / Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install liblua5.4-dev
```
**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S lua54
```
**Fedora / RHEL / CentOS Stream / Alma / Rocky:**
```bash
sudo dnf install lua-devel
```
**macOS:**
```bash
brew install lua
```
**Windows:**
Download and install the latest Lua for Windows from [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/download.html).

# Building and Installing SDL3_mixer, SDL3_image, and SDL_ttf
Clone the repositories:
```
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer.git
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image.git
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf.git
```

## Build per SDL3:
```
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
cd SDL
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make -j$(nproc)
make install
```

## Build and install SDL3 libraries
```
# build SDL
cd SDL
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc) 
sudo make install

# build SDL_mixer
cd ../../SDL_mixer
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

## Sol2 (recommended)
Clone Sol2 into a dedicated third-party folder inside your project:
```
git clone https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2.git
```
**Note:** When integrating Sol2 and Lua, make sure to:
- Add the Sol2 include folder (e.g. include or third_party/sol2/include) to your compiler or IDE‚Äôs include path.
- Add the Lua include folder (e.g. lua5.3 or /usr/include/lua5.4) to your include path.
- Link to the Lua library (-llua5.3 or -llua5.4) in your build system (Makefile, CMake, etc.).
Example snippet in CMakeLists.txt:
```
include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/third_party/sol2/include)
include_directories(/usr/include/lua5.3)
find_library(LUA_LIB lua5.3)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ${LUA_LIB})
```

## Documentation
Documentation is generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/):
```bash
doxygen docs/Doxyfile
```
Output will be in the `docs/html/` directory.

Additional docs:
- Overall architecture diagram: docs/architecture_overview.md

### Exporting Mermaid Diagrams to PNG/SVG (for Doxygen)

We embed Mermaid diagrams in Markdown. To export them as images for inclusion in generated HTML (or for environments without Mermaid support), install mermaid-cli and run the helper script:

Debian:
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Install Mermaid CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
bash scripts/export_mermaid.sh
```

Outputs are written to `docs/diagrams/<doc-name>/diagram-XX.png|svg`.
