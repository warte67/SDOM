## Overview
The SDOM Framework is a modern C++23 library designed to provide a Document Object Model (DOM) abstraction for SDL3 applications. It enables developers to create and manage graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and interactive elements in a structured, hierarchical manner. The framework is ideal for game development, prototyping, and other cross-platform applications requiring a robust and extensible GUI system. SDOM is designed to be more data-driven, allowing GUI elements to be configured via `.json` files or through the use of initialization structures. This approach enables easier customization, dynamic UI generation, and better separation of logic and presentation.


## Features
- Simple, composable API for UI and document structures
- Modern C++23 codebase
- Minimal dependencies (SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_ttf)
- Designed for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility

## IDataObject: Data-Driven Base Type

`SDOM::IDataObject` is a flexible, data-driven base class designed for use in SDOM. It allows you to register property accessors (getters and setters) and commands that can be accessed and manipulated via JSON, enabling dynamic configuration, serialization, and behavior of objects.

### Key Features
- Register property accessors for any property using `registerProperty()`
- Get and set properties by name using `getProperty()` and `setProperty()`
- Supports chaining of setters for fluent configuration
- Register and invoke commands (actions) using `registerCommand()` and `command()`
- Designed for integration with JSON (using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json))

## Identifier Conventions

To ensure clarity and consistency across both C++ and Lua, SDOM uses the following naming conventions:

- **Properties and Data Members:**  
  Use `snake_case` (all lowercase, words separated by underscores).  
  Examples: `font_size`, `border_color`, `resource_name`, `tab_enabled`

- **Functions and Methods:**  
  Use `lowerCamelCase` (first word lowercase, subsequent words capitalized).  
  Examples: `setFontSize()`, `getWidth()`, `registerLuaBindings()`

- **Classes, Structs, Enums, and Types:**
  use 'UpperCamelCase` (first word capitcapitalized, subsequent words capitalized)
  Examples: `Button`, `IDisplayObject`, `Label`, `ListBox`, `ComboBox`

- **Private/Protected Members:**  
  End with an underscore (`_`).  
  Example: `name_`, `type_`, `left_`, `anchor_left_`

- **Private/Protected Methods:**  
  Begin with a single underscore (`_`).  
  Example: `_registerLuaBindings()`, `_initBounds()`

**Lua Configuration:**  
- All property keys should be written in `snake_case`.
- Functions exposed to Lua follow the same `lowerCamelCase` convention as C++.

**Migration Note:**  
Older code and examples may use `camelCase` or other styles. These will be updated over time. During transition, both forms may be accepted for compatibility. Please be patient and forgive my laziness and bad habbits. This falls into one of those "get it working first, then make it pretty" categories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++23 compatible compiler
- SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_ttf development libraries
- CMake 3.20 or newer

### Building the SDOM Library
```
git clone https://github.com/warte67/SDOM.git
cd SDOM
./rebuild # to build and install the SDOM library from this folder
```

### Running the Example
```
cd examples/test
./compile # to only build files which have changed
# or
./compile clean # to completely rebuild the library and the test example
./prog # to run the test example
```

### Notable recent changes
- Symbol rename: DisplayObject -> DisplayHandle and AssetObject -> AssetHandle across the codebase and Lua scripts (Oct 2025).
  - The code and examples have been updated; some diagrams and docs still reference the old names and will be updated in a follow-up.
  - Lua compatibility: Lua userdata/type names remain stable where necessary; check the README/changelog for per-release compatibility notes.

### Migration notes
- If you maintain scripts that referenced the old names, search & replace DisplayObject / AssetObject -> DisplayHandle / AssetHandle.
- The repository includes transitional aliases during migration for staged rollouts (if present); prefer the new names in new code.

```

## Freetype on Debian:
Freetype may not be installed in Debian by default.
```
sudo apt install libfreetype-dev
```

## Building and Installing SDL3_mixer, SDL3_image, and SDL_ttf
Clone the repositories:
```
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer.git
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image.git
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf.git
```

## Build per SDL3:
```
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
cd SDL
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make -j$(nproc)
make install
```

## Build and install SDL3 libraries
```
# build SDL
cd SDL
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

## Lua and Sol2
Make sure lua is installed. 
Debian:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev
```
or
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install liblua5.4-dev
```

Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S lua53
```
or
```
sudo pacman -S lua54
```
**Recommended:**  
Clone Sol2 into a dedicated third-party folder inside your project:
```
git clone https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2.git
```
**Note:** When integrating Sol2 and Lua, make sure to:
- Add the Sol2 include folder (e.g. include or third_party/sol2/include) to your compiler or IDEâ€™s include path.
- Add the Lua include folder (e.g. lua5.3 or /usr/include/lua5.4) to your include path.
- Link to the Lua library (-llua5.3 or -llua5.4) in your build system (Makefile, CMake, etc.).
Example snippet in CMakeLists.txt:
```
include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/third_party/sol2/include)
include_directories(/usr/include/lua5.3)
find_library(LUA_LIB lua5.3)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ${LUA_LIB})
```

### Exporting Mermaid Diagrams to PNG/SVG (for Doxygen)

We embed Mermaid diagrams in Markdown. To export them as images for inclusion in generated HTML (or for environments without Mermaid support), install mermaid-cli and run the helper script:

Debian:
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Install Mermaid CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
bash scripts/export_mermaid.sh
```

Outputs are written to `docs/diagrams/<doc-name>/diagram-XX.png|svg`.
