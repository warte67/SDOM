 * The SDOM_EventTypeHash struct provides a custom hash functor for the EventType class, 
 * enabling efficient use of EventType objects as keys in unordered associative containers such 
 * as std::unordered_map and std::unordered_set. By hashing the event typeâ€™s name, this functor 
 * ensures that event types can be quickly and uniquely identified within hash-based data 
 * structures. This is essential for fast event lookup, registration, and dispatching within 
 * the SDOM event system, supporting scalable and performant event-driven programming.
